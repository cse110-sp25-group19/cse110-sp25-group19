- **Fun Fact:** Even though I swore I'd never drink, I accidentally had half a mojito before realizing it contained alcohol. I didn’t know much about alcoholic drinks and (naively, in hindsight 😅) assumed mojitos were alcohol-free. The strange buzz I had after brought me to the realization that mojitos have alcohol.😭
