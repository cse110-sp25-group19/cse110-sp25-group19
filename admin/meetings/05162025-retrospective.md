## 💬 Notes / Decisions

- use retrium and evaluate our performace from last week
- according to the patterns, some people are feeling confident on their tasks while others are not
- Most people think our work last week had a lot of clarity
- What surprises us: we are doing good and everyone was consistant and communicating well
- lowest average was mastery, highest average was clarity
- engagement and meaning was both at an average of 3.9
- No outliers
- Moving on, we voted and made nots on what parts made us Mad, Sad, and Glad
- Some things frustrated us was that lack of discussions during slack meetings
- Some things that made us sad was that not getting exposed by other parts of the project, communication and many issues required others to finish first, and CI/CD pipeline was not set correctly first
- Some things we were glad about was that every issue was finished and we were able to communicated well with eachother
- voted on which topics were the most important:
  - the voted point was that we are not getting exposed to other prospects of the project and only working on one thing.
  - we also voted that the work load should be increased
  - finished everything in timely manner
  - lack of discussion in meetings
  - we should let everyone know in slack when you finished your issue/task
