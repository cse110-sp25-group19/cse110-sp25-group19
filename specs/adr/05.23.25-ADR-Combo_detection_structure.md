# ADR: Combo Detection Structure

## 1. Context

We had to choose how to structure the detection of combo actions within the game.  
We considered three main approaches: state-based, timer-based, and event-driven detection.

## 2. Decision

We chose **timer-based detection** because it best meets our needs:

- Balances simplicity with flexibility in detecting sequences within a time window
- Easier to implement and debug compared to event-driven systems

## 3. Consequences

- **Positive**: Clear timing window for combos; straightforward logic for developers
- **Negative**: Less reactive to complex input patterns compared to event-driven systems

### Example of “Considered Options”

- **State-based**: Tracks sequences through game states; can be rigid and hard to scale
- **Timer-based**: Uses time windows to check for combos; flexible and simple
- **Event-driven**: Reacts to input events dynamically; powerful but more complex to implement
