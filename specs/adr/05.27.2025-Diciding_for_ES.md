title: Deciding for ES Module
---

# 1. Context

- We need to organize our JavaScript code in a scalable and maintainable way.
- The application is growing, with multiple files such as `utils.js`, `game.js`, and others.
- We want to use modern JavaScript practices supported across all modern browsers.

# 2. Decision

We choose **ECMAScript Modules (ES Modules)** because it best meets our needs:

- Promotes modularity and clear code separation into reusable modules.
- Enables explicit `import`/`export` syntax for better dependency management.
- Aligns with JavaScript standards and modern development workflows.

# 3. Consequences

**Positive:**

- Code is more maintainable and easier to test.
- Dependencies are clearly defined and scoped.
- Supported natively by all modern browsers and build tools.

**Negative:**

- Scripts must be loaded using `<script type="module">`.
- Modules must be served over HTTP(s) and cannot be loaded via `file://` without a local server.
- Relative or absolute paths are required in import statements (e.g., `./utils.js`).

# Considered Options

**Option A:** Use ES Modules – standard-compliant, modular, and modern (✅ chosen)  
**Option B:** Use CommonJS – legacy Node.js system, not browser-native  
**Option C:** Use global script tags – fast and simple, but not maintainable
