# 1. Context
- We needed to decide how to implement the in-game timer: counting up or down.
- The timer affects gameplay dynamics, difficulty scaling, and user motivation.
- The feature ties into game over conditions and leaderboard design.

# 2. Decision
We choose **counting down** because it best meets our needs:

- Creates natural tension and pressure as the player races against time.
- Allows difficulty to scale by reducing the available time per level or game mode.
- Enables a meaningful score system by allowing players to improve their remaining time or survive longer in replays.

# 3. Consequences
**Positive:**
- More engaging gameplay with a clear win/lose condition (time runs out = game over).
- Replay value increased through a scoreboard that encourages beating previous times.
- Easy to balance game difficulty by adjusting countdown duration.

**Negative:**
- Requires visual and auditory cues to warn players as time runs low.
- Players may feel more stressed compared to an open-ended timer.

# Considered Options
**Option A:** Countdown timer – pressure-based, supports game over and leaderboard (✅ chosen)  
**Option B:** Count-up timer – tracks duration, but lacks built-in failure condition  
**Option C:** No timer – relaxed gameplay, but no time-based scoring or urgency
