# ADR: Flip & Match Game

## 1. Context

We needed to pick a team project that

- Demonstrates both UI and game-logic skills
- Allows clear division of frontend/backend work
- Fits within our limited schedule

## 2. Decision

We choose **Flip & Match Game** because it:

- Combines a simple grid UI with interactive card logic
- Offers enough challenge

## 3. Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Teaches event handling, state management, and DOM updates
  - Breaks cleanly into sub-tasks for each team role
- **Negative**:
  - Requires careful asset naming and layout planning
  - Scope creep if adding advanced features (animations, timer, leaderboards)

### Considered Options

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  A two-player grid game; too simple and limited in scope.
- **Flip & Match Game**  
  A memory card game; balanced complexity and clear UI/game logic split.
- **To-Do List App**  
  Standard CRUD app; doesnâ€™t showcase interactive graphics or game logic.
